# Ackermann
Ackermann Function yielding ackermann number

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function

This is just a proof of concept code. I was basically interested in Ackermann function after one yutube video, and decided to code it in python. Since it is functional and recursive and yields high values quckly it is advised to tweak recursion depht in your python ;)

Input positive integer, output ackermann number.
